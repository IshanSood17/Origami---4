        <h1>When It Comes To Your Mind What Is Origami?</h1>
        <h2>What Do You Think?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes). An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish.</i></li>
            <li><i>At its essence, origami is the traditional Japanese game of folding elaborately designed paper into a myriad of shapes, typically plants, animals, and other living things. ... Part of what makes origami unique is the fact that it simply requires a piece of paper and a creative imagination.</i></li>
